==Introduction to Web Automation Hybrid Framework==
Hybrid framework using keywords and excel data to execute test cases. Test cases are divided into reusable keywords representing actions. Keywords and associated data are stored externally. Framework interprets keywords and executes corresponding actions. Promotes modularity, reusability, and collaboration. Allows easy maintenance and scalability. Structured approach to test automation.​​

==Advantages==
The advantage of a Hybrid framework is its modularity and reusability. By separating the test cases from selenium code, the framework allows for easy maintenance and scalability. Changes in the application or test data can be accommodated by modifying the keywords and associated data without requiring changes to the underlying automation code.​

==Where this Framework is applicable​==
Some of the sectors where Hybrid frameworks can be used include:​

1. Software Development and IT Services:​
In the software development industry, Hybrid frameworks can be used to automate testing processes, ensuring software quality and faster releases.​
2.   E-commerce and Retail: ​
For e-commerce websites and retail applications, Hybrid testing can be employed to verify the functionality of online shopping, payment processing, and inventory management.​
3.   Healthcare:​
In the healthcare sector, Hybrid frameworks can be used to test electronic health record (EHR) systems, medical software, and patient management applications etc. Finance and Banking, Telecommunications, Travel and Hospitality, Government and Public Sector and Education.​

==Why Hybrid testing & Advantages​==
-It allows functional testers to plan test automation before the application is ready​
-Tests can be developed without programming knowledge​
-Can automate any website by writing test steps in excel sheet​
-Common components handled by standard library​
-Using this approach tests can be written in a more abstract manner​
-High degree of reusability​
-The detail of the script is hidden from the users​
-The test is concise, maintainable and flexible​
-It helps to reduce maintenance cost​
-Avoids duplicated specifications​
-Greater reuse of function scripting​
-Better testing support and portability​
-Achieve more testing with less or same effort

==Disadvantages==
-All test cases are written inside excel file and execution little bit slow compares to other frameworks​
-Excel file (Testcase file) structure / column headers should not modify​
